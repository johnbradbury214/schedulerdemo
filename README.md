Notes:
As the assessment constraints didn't allow for external packages/libs, I decided to not implement adjustments to scheduled times to account for TimeZone differences based on selected appointment location. If I were to implement such a feature, I would use a package such as moment.js. I believe implementation is entirely possible in vanilla React however I felt this was not the best use of my allotted time.
